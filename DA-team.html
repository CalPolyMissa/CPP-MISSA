                During the fall semester, MISSA Data Analytics Team members will
                engage in weekly meetings to learn and practice the
                <strong>Data Exploration and Analysis Process</strong>. Members
                will also enhance their leadership skills by teaching one of
                three workshops focused on essential data visualization tools:
                <strong>SQL, Tableau, or Python</strong>. To support success,
                clear guidelines and resources are provided for workshop
                preparation and delivery.
                <br />
                <br />
                Key learning objectives include:
              </p>
              <li>
                Performing data cleaning and exploration to uncover insights.
              </li>
              <li>
                Building dashboards and reports for effective data
                communication.
              </li>
              <li>
                Communicating insights clearly to technical and non-technical
                audiences.
              </li>
              <br />
              <p>
                To put their skills into action, members will complete a 3-week
                case study, applying tools and techniques to a real-world
                dataset. This hands-on project prepares members for the
                semester-long projects and gives them practical experience
                solving data challenges. This structured training ensures team
                members are ready to tackle industry-level problems with
                confidence and expertise.
