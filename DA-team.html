            <p>
              During the fall semester, MISSA Data Analytics Team members will
              engage in weekly meetings to learn and practice the
              <strong>Data Exploration and Analysis Process</strong>. Members
              will also enhance their leadership skills by teaching one of
              three workshops focused on essential data visualization tools:
              <strong>SQL, Tableau, or Python</strong>. To support success,
              clear guidelines and resources are provided for workshop
              preparation and delivery.
              <br />
              <br />
              Key learning objectives include:
            </p>
            <li>
              Performing data cleaning and exploration to uncover insights.
            </li>
            <li>
              Building dashboards and reports for effective data
              communication.
            </li>
            <li>
              Communicating insights clearly to technical and non-technical
              audiences.
            </li>
            <br />
            <p>
              To put their skills into action, members will complete a 3-week
              case study, applying tools and techniques to a real-world
              dataset. This hands-on project prepares members for the
              semester-long projects and gives them practical experience
              solving data challenges. This structured training ensures team
              members are ready to tackle industry-level problems with
              confidence and expertise.

                  The Research Methods and Data Science Lab (also known as the RMDS Lab) is a community of analysts and researchers 
                  based out of Pasadena, CA. They aim to empower the scientific community and advance contributions through 
                  certification training, data impact consultation and other AI-powered services. During Spring 2021, the RMDS lab 
                  held a data science competition with the premise being to use machine learning along with other data analytics 
                  techniques to analyze how news sentiment, along with other factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and a regionâ€™s 
                  mobility index, affected different stock prices of the fossil fuel industry. The 2021-2022 Co-Directors of the 
                  DA team, Ryan Peji and Marisa Nakanishi, took lead of this project and found it as a valuable learning experience.

                  ISACA Los Angeles Chapter, So Cal Edison, and MISSA's Data Analytics team worked together to work on a case study 
                  to analyze data and visualize data using PowerBI and Tableau to provide recommendations to SCE as to where to place 
                  Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in the most effective locations. The goal is to place the EV charging stations 
                  in areas that would make EV charging more accessible to residents living in multifamily buildings. At least 50% 
                  of the stations must be located in environmentally impacted and disadvantaged communities in order to encourage 
                  EV adoption in those areas. The team will be presenting their findings and teaching industry professionals how to 
                  achieve similar dashboards during the SheLeadsTech Conference.
